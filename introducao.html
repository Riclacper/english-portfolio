  <h1>Academic Portfolio Introduction</h1>

  <p>
    My name is <b>Ricardo Lacerda Pereira</b> and I am a student of
    <b>Analysis and Systems Development (ADS)</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This academic portfolio was developed as part of the English course
    recovery activity. The objective is to organize and present the activities
    carried out during the semester, demonstrating the use of English in an
    academic and technological context.
  </p>

  <p>
    This portfolio is also related to my <b>English review system</b>,
    which was created to help beginner students learn and review basic
    English content in a simple and practical way.
