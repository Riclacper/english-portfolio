  <h1>Rec’n’Play Experience</h1>
</header>

<main>
  <p>
    <b>Rec’n’Play</b> is an event held in Recife that brings together technology,
    innovation, creativity, and education. The event offers lectures, workshops,
    and activities that connect students and professionals with current trends
    in the technology market.
  </p>

  <p>
    My experience at Rec’n’Play was very important because I had contact with
    new ideas, current technologies, and professionals in the field. The event
    showed how technology is present in different areas and how learning goes
    beyond the classroom.
  </p>

  <p>
    For the <b>Analysis and Systems Development (ADS)</b> course, Rec’n’Play is
    fundamental because it helps students better understand the job market,
    encourages the search for knowledge, and reinforces the importance of
    practice and constant updating.
  </p>

  <p>
    Participating in this event increased my motivation in the course and
    contributed to expanding my view of professional possibilities in the
    technology field.
